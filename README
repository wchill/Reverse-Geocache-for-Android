Reverse Geocache for Android
============================

This Android app is designed to work with my reverse geocache design.
This app is designed to perform the following tasks:
- Provide the UI in lieu of a screen mounted on the reverse geocache
- Provide a GPS in lieu of a module in the reverse geocache
- Enable unlocking/relocking of the box after the puzzle has been solved
- Allow the dynamic reprogramming of the reverse geocache's memory
- Allow the reset of the currently saved puzzle for later use

Note that the reverse geocache can be repurposed for other uses: eg. a safe.
This is merely one relevant application of my reverse geocache design.

The following parts are needed:
-IOIO Mint or equivalent solution
-Servo
-Locking mechanism
-Momentary push button with LED
-Pololu push button power switch
-External 24LC256 EEPROM or equivalent I2C replacement
-0.1uF decoupling capacitors
-10k ohm resistor
-Wall-mount USB A + B ports (optional, but nice to have)
-JST-PH battery extension cable (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1131)
-Wire, solder, etc.
-Android phone running Android 4.0 or higher (older phones can use CyanogenMod,
 check forum.xda-developers.com and search for the device for more details)

I recommend IOIO Mint (https://www.adafruit.com/products/885) for a
self-contained solution that has an IOIO board, Bluetooth dongle and USB port,
500mAh LiPo battery and integrated charger as well as a way to measure battery
voltage easily.

Assembly instructions assume an IOIO Mint is being used.

To assemble:
-Connect the servo to pin 3/SERVO_PIN on IOIO and wire to power/0v and mount.
-Connect the Pololu OFF control pin to pin 2/POWER_OFF_PIN on IOIO.
-Wire up the momentary push button to the Pololu switch and mount.
-Connect push button LED pins to Pololu Vout/GND.
-Wire the Pololu switch GND pin to IOIO GND.
-Cut one wire on the JST-PH cable and wire the ends to Vin/Vout on Pololu.
-Connect the JST-PH cable to IOIO and LiPo battery.
-Connect the 10k ohm resistor to Vout on Pololu and GND.
-Connect EEPROM pins 1-4 to GND and pin 5 to 3.3V on IOIO.
-Connect EEPROM pin 7 to IOIO pin 48 and EEPROM pin 8 to IOIO pin 47.
-Place 0.1uF capacitor on EEPROM pin 4-5.
-Use 10k resistors to pull up EEPROM pin 7 and 8 to 3.3V on IOIO.
-Mount USB A/B ports and connect to IOIO. Insert Bluetooth dongle if desired.
-Mount locking mechanism inside box and attach to servo.
-Close box, power on and use app to program.

Note that with this design, the battery will not charge unless the push button
is used to power on. This is in the interest of keeping the IOIO Mint intact.
If this behavior poses a problem, the recommended solution is to desolder
the onboard switch on the IOIO Mint and connect the Pololu switch to it,
skipping the JST-PH cable modification and the 10k pulldown resistor.
