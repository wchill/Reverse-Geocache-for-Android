Reverse Geocache for Android
============================

This Android app is designed to work with my reverse geocache design.
This app is designed to perform the following tasks:
- Provide the UI in lieu of a screen mounted on the reverse geocache
- Provide a GPS in lieu of a module in the reverse geocache
- Enable unlocking/relocking of the box after the puzzle has been solved
- Allow the dynamic reprogramming of the reverse geocache's memory
- Allow the reset of the currently saved puzzle for later use

Note that the reverse geocache can be repurposed for other uses: eg. a safe.
This is merely one relevant application of my reverse geocache design.

Build instructions for the reverse geocache are here:

Note that with this design, the battery will not charge unless the push button
is used to power on. This is in the interest of keeping the IOIO Mint intact.
If this behavior poses a problem, the recommended solution is to desolder
the onboard switch on the IOIO Mint and connect the Pololu switch to it,
skipping the JST-PH cable modification and the 10k pulldown resistor.
